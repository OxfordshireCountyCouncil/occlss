The accordion component lets users show and hide sections of related content on a page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "accordion", example: "default", html: true }) }}

## When to use this component

Accordions can be used to show and hide information that might part of larger or more complex areas of content.

## When not to use

Accordions hide content from users and not everyone will notice or understand them. They shouldnâ€™t be used for content that is essential to all users.

Before using an accordion:

- consider reducing or simplifying the content
- splitting the content up across several pages
- separating the content with headings on a single page use an index page or jump-links page that allows users to quickly navigate to content they want.

Accordions work best when they contain simple content and links. Avoid using accordions for frequently asked questions, use a jump-links page instead.
