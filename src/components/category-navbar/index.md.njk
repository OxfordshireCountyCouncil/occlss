## Category navbar

{{ example({group: "components", item: "category-navbar", example: "default", html: true }) }}

### Why we use this component 

The category navbar splits the website into three main user groups. The majority of the content sits under the residents category with business and council being more specialist areas.

The residents category also forms the main homepage for the website. Business and council have their own homepages.
