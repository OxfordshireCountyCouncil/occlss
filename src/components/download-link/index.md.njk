The download link component is used where we want to draw attention to a particular document available for download. 

{{ example({group: "components", item: "download-link", example: "default", html: true }) }}

## When to use this component 

Use this component for a document that is particularly important within the content of a page and may otherwise be lost in a paragraph of text.
