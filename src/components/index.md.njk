Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications. 

Individual components can be used in multiple different patterns and contexts. For example, the text input component can be used to ask for an email address, a postcode or someoneâ€™s name.

Each component has a set of rules that determine how and when it should be used.
