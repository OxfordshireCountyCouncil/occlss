Our colour palette is designed to communicate trustworthiness and professionalism while remaining approachable.

All of our colours have been carefully chosen to meet accessibility standards.

The colour swatches below include the hex value and the SASS variable for each corresponding colour.

## Wayfinding colours

Colours from this palette are used to distinguish between the residents, business, and council sections.

### Residents

The dark green is the council’s corporate colour and forms the base of the colour palette.

{{ UIel({
    item: "color-box",
    boxes: [
        {
            hexColor: "#00483a",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-aqua-deep"
        },{
            hexColor: "#d3dfdd",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-nebula"
        }
    ]
}) }}


### Business

The blue represents the council’s professionalism and is inspired particularly by the science and technology industries based in Oxfordshire.

{{ UIel({
    item: "color-box",
    boxes: [
        {
            hexColor: "#3a78bb",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-boston-blue"
        },{
            hexColor: "#d9ecf6",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-link-water"
        }
    ]
}) }}

            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-bleach-white"
        }
    ]
}) }}


## Search button colours

These colours are only used for the search button so that it can be easily recognised by frequent visitors to the website and will stand out from any other call to action on the page.

{{ UIel({
    item: "color-box",
    boxes: [
        {
            hexColor: "#edc856",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-ronchi"
        },{
            hexColor: "#d0a116",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-pizza"
        },{
            hexColor: "#B48C13",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-sahara"
        },{
            hexColor: "#f5de98",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-maize"
        }
    ]
}) }}


## Typography colours

The typography colours were chosen to provide good contrast with the website’s white background. The darkest colours are also used for text on promoted panels were white text does not provide enough contrast.

{{ UIel({
    item: "color-box",
    boxes: [
        {
            hexColor: "#000000",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-black"
        },{
            hexColor: "#525252",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-emperor"
        },{
            hexColor: "#1a1a1a",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-cod-gray"
        },{
            hexColor: "#0B0C0C",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-woodsmoke"
        },{
            hexColor: "#fcfcfc",
            sassVar: "$occlss-brand-color-alabaster"
        }
    ]
